        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Quasar Contact is dedicated to providing secure, private
          communication for everyone. In an age where digital privacy is
          increasingly under threat, I believe that secure communication
          should be accessible, reliable, and completely private.

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I've built a messaging platform that implements military-grade
          end-to-end encryption, ensuring that your conversations remain
          completely private. My zero-knowledge architecture means that I
          cannot access your messages, even if I wanted to.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          All messages are encrypted using Web Crypto API (AES-GCM) before
          leaving your device. Server never has access to decryption keys or plaintext
          messages. Instant message delivery via WebSocket connections. Installable on desktop and mobile devices with offline support.

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
          Quasar Contact is built using modern web technologies including
          Angular 18, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB. The encryption is
          handled client-side using the Web Crypto API, ensuring maximum
          security and privacy.

        <h2>Privacy First</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy is at the core of everything I do. I collect minimal data
          (only email addresses for user identification), implement end-to-end
          encryption, and maintain a zero-knowledge architecture. I do not
          sell, share, or analyze your personal data.
