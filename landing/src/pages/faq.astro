        <h3 class="faq-question">What is Quasar Contact?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Quasar Contact is a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging
            platform that prioritizes your privacy. I use military-grade
            encryption to ensure your conversations remain completely
            private and secure.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How does the encryption work?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            I use client-side encryption with the Web Crypto API,
            implementing AES-GCM encryption. Your messages are encrypted on
            your device before being sent, and only the intended recipient
            can decrypt them. The server never has access to your encryption
            keys or plaintext messages.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What data do you collect?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            I collect minimal data - only your email address for user
            identification and authentication. I do not collect, store, or
            analyze your message content, contacts, or any other personal
            information. All messages are stored encrypted and cannot be
            read by me.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Is Quasar Contact free to use?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, Quasar Contact is currently free to use during the alpha
            stage. I'm focused on building the best secure messaging
            platform and gathering user feedback.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Can you read my messages?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No, I cannot read your messages. My zero-knowledge architecture
            ensures that all encryption and decryption happens on your
            device. Even if I wanted to, I don't have the keys to decrypt
            your messages.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Is the source code available?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            I believe in transparency and plan to open-source parts of my
            codebase in the future. This will allow security researchers and
            the community to audit my encryption implementation.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How do I delete my account?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You can delete your account at any time through the settings
            page. When you delete your account, all your personal data is
            permanently removed from my servers, including your encrypted
            messages.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What happens if I lose my device?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Your encryption keys are stored locally on your device. If you
            lose your device, you'll need to log in again on a new device,
            which will generate new keys. Messages sent before the key
            change cannot be decrypted on the new device for security
            reasons.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Do you comply with GDPR?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, I am fully GDPR compliant. I collect minimal data,
            implement privacy by design, and give you full control over your
            data. You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How can I report a security issue?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact me
            immediately at artem.turlenko@quasar.contact. I take security issues
            very seriously and will respond promptly to any reports.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Will there be mobile apps?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>While Quasar Contact already works great on mobile browsers and can be installed as a PWA, I'm considering native mobile apps in the future based on user demand and feedback.</p>
